I'm going to be at several conferences over the next month or so. I
always like to meet up with people who are using
[mondrian](https://mondrian.pentaho.com/),
[olap4j](http://www.olap4j.org/),
[Pentaho](https://www.pentaho.com/) and
[LucidDB](http://www.luciddb.org/) to do open source BI, so
put these on your schedule.

On Wednesday September 1, there is an
[Eigenbase Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Eigenbase-Developers/calendar/14311008/) at
[SQLstream](https://www.sqlstream.com/)'s offices in San
Francisco. I predict that it will be a reunion, of sorts, for people
who worked on LucidDB at
[LucidEra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LucidEra), but you
will also hear about new features that Nick Goodman is adding as part
of [DynamoDB](http://www.dynamobi.com/) (including closer
integration with Pentaho), John Sichi's work on
[Firewater](http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/FirewaterDistributedArchitecture)
(a project to build a scalable shared-nothing database based on
LucidDB) and contributions SQLstream developers are making to
Eigenbase. And there will be beer.

At 9.00pm on Tuesday September 21,
[Luc Boudreau](https://twitter.com/luclemagnifique) is giving a
talk about olap4j at
[Java One](http://java.dzone.com/articles/javaone-2010-accepted-talks).
I will be in the audience, on hand to answer the questions
that Luc considers beneath his dignity. This is a Birds of a Feather
(BoF) talk, which means that it will be less formal than a usual
conference talk, you can attend even if you have not paid to attend
the conference, and yes, there will be beer.

Lastly, I will be attending the 3rd annual
[Pentaho Community Gathering](https://wiki.pentaho.com/display/COM/Pentaho+Community+Gathering+-+Portugal+2010)
on September 25-26 in Lisbon, Portugal, and
giving a talk about what's new in Mondrian and open-source
OLAP. Meetups in previous years have been great fun, a good chance to
network, and a great chance to find out all of the great stuff that
the Pentaho community is working with and extending the Pentaho BI
suite. Even though Portugal is better known for producing wine, I
wouldn't be surprised if at some point there was beer.
