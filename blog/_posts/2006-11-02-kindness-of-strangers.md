<p>I just received  an important and insightful email:</p><blockquote><tt>From: Bingham [diffusecrepe@rotten.cc]<br />To: Julian Hyde<br />Subject: Enjoy ssex with her!<br /><br />Dear member. Thousands of couples broke down because of them, making both parties unhappy. Your problems will be fixed with Extra-Time, a complex method of dealing with all the reasons. Don't let your partner leave you because of being unhappy with the duration of your acts. See our offer: http://a.url.com/y/et/ You won't forget your eyes after you finally gave her the long-lasting love. She'll go crazy about you!<br /></tt></blockquote>Stilted and awkward though his English is, Bingham is sensitive and perceptive. He clearly understands the inner workings of my relationship with my new wife â€” and is concerned with nothing more than our marital bliss. What a wonderful world, that complete strangers are sending us these generous help with our relationships, completely unsolicited. Heartwarming.
