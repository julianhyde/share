A few months ago I wrote about <a href="http://julianhyde.blogspot.com/2007/09/openmrs.html">OpenMRS</a>, an excellent open-source project that is enabling hospitals and medical practices in developing countries to automate medical record-keeping, built using <a href="http://www.pentaho.org/">Pentaho</a> technology including <a href="http://mondrian.pentaho.org/">mondrian</a>.<br /><br />So it was good to hear a radio segment about OpenMRS on <a href="http://www.theworld.org/">PRI's "The World"</a> this afternoon, including an interview about how it is helping a hospital in Haiti. You can listen to it via <a href="http://clarkboyd.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/wtp-213-openmrs-open-source-medical-record-systems-for-the-developing-world/">Clark Boyd's blog</a>.
