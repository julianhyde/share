A few months ago I wrote about
[OpenMRS](https://julianhyde.blogspot.com/2007/09/openmrs.html),
an excellent open-source project that is enabling hospitals and
medical practices in developing countries to automate medical
record-keeping, built using [Pentaho](https://www.pentaho.org/)
technology including [mondrian](https://mondrian.pentaho.org/).

So it was good to hear a radio segment about OpenMRS on
[PRI's "The World"](http://www.theworld.org/) this afternoon,
including an interview about how it is helping a hospital in
Haiti. You can listen to it via
[Clark Boyd's blog](https://clarkboyd.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/wtp-213-openmrs-open-source-medical-record-systems-for-the-developing-world/).
