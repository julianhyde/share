A limerick featuring my family name and ending with a pun. What could be better?<br /><br />An unfortunate fellow named Hyde<br />fell down an outhouse and died.<br />By mischance, his brother<br />fell down another.<br />And now they're interred side-by-side.<br /><br />(Reportedly due to Johnny Carson.)
