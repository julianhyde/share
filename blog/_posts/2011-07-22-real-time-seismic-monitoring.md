Marc Berkowitz wrote a <a href="http://www.sqlstream.com/blog/2011/07/real-time-seismic-monitoring-in-the-cloud-with-sqlstream/">blog post describing an application of SQLstream to power a seismic monitoring project</a> that is a collaboration between several leading research institutions.<br /><br />The project is interesting in several respects:<br /><br /><ul><li>The project involves signal processing. Unlike the "event-processing" application that we see most often at SQLstream, events arrive at a regular rate (generally 40 readings every second, per sensor). In signal processing, events are more likely to be processed using complex mathematical formulas (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transforms</a>) than by boolean logic (event A happened, then event B happened). Using SQLstream's user-defined function framework, we were easily able to accommodate this form of processing.</li><li>It illustrates how a stream-computing "fabric" can be created, connecting multiple SQLstream processing nodes using <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>.</li><li>One of the reasons for building a distributed system was to allow an agile approach. Researchers can easily deploy new algorithms without affecting the performance or correctness of other algorithms running in the cloud.</li><li>Another goal of the distributed system was performance and scalability. Nodes can easily be added to accommodate greater numbers of sensors. The system is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarassingly parallel</a>, but we were still able to parallelize the solution effectively.</li><li>Lastly, the system needs to be both continuous and real-time. "Continuous" meaning that data is processed as it arrives; a smoother, more predictable and more efficient mode of operation than ETL. "Real-time" because some of the potential outputs of the system, such as tsunami alerts, need to be delivered as soon as possible in order to be useful.</li></ul>In all, a very interesting case study of what SQLstream is capable of. Marc plans to make follow-up posts describing the solution in more detail, so <a href="http://www.sqlstream.com/blog/">stay tuned</a>.
