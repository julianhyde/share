SQLstream release 2.0
[hit the streets today](https://www.businesswire.com/news/google/20090126005383/en).
It's actually our third release, but it's the
first one we've made a fuss about. Since release 1.1, we have hardened
the product at customer deployments, introduced 64 bit support to
allow larger working memory, and added two major SQL extensions:
streaming aggregation and user-defined transforms.

Streaming aggregation adds support for the GROUP BY construct to
streaming SQL, and allows us to compute totals on a periodic basis,
for example computing hourly subtotals. SQLstream acts as a
continuously operating conduit between operational systems and the
data warehouse, replacing the traditional batch-based ETL process and
populating the fact table and aggregate tables simultaneously. This
gives us a
[natural synergy](https://julianhyde.blogspot.com/2008/02/streaming-sql-meets-olap.html)
with my other project, the [Mondrian OLAP engine](https://mondrian.pentaho.org/),
and we have been getting good take-up among
[Pentaho](https://www.pentaho.com/)'s customers.

Streaming aggregation builds on relational operators in SQLstream 1.1
such as joins, windowed aggregations and unions. Those relational
operators allowed you to build queries such as fraud detection,
looking for anamolous rows in real time. Those were 'needle in the
haystack' kinds of problem, and the new features also allow you to do
build a high-performance 'water main' between your operational system
and data warehouse.

User-defined transforms allow you to define new relational operators
in Java and incorporate them into streaming SQL statements. SQLstream
1.1 had user-defined functions, to allow you to compute scalar
quantities in Java, and syntactically, user-defined transforms are
simply functions that have JDBC
[ResultSets](https://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html)
and [PreparedStatements](https://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html)
as parameters. If a function has a PreparedStatement as a parameter,
SQLstream lets you include it in the FROM clause of a SQL statement as
a data source, alongside regular streams, tables, and
views. Similarly, if a function has a ResultSet as a parameter, then
you can pass in a cursor based on a SELECT statement as an argument.

User-defined transforms are an excellent example of our ongoing
collaboration with the open-source [Eigenbase project](http://www.eigenbase.org/).
User-defined transforms were originally developed for
[LucidDB](http://www.luciddb.org/) to operate on traditional
stored relational data, with SQL:2003-compliant syntax, and we
extended them to handle streaming relational data, but keeping the
syntax the same. For more about user-defined transforms in LucidDB,
see the [excellent documentation at Eigenbase](http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbUdxJavaHowto).

Release 2.0 is a major milestone for SQLstream, and is the culmination
of several years of development. It allows you to tackle in
industry-standard SQL some application areas that previously required
guile and custom coding. Go to [www.sqlstream.com](https://www.sqlstream.com/)
and see whether there is a fit with your real-time BI application.
