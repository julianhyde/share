I'm one of those folks who runs Windows on my laptop out of habit, but
I'm not passionate about it. I run Ubuntu on my server, and am happy
with that, and have considered moving to Mac OS just so I can have one
of those cool, shiny Apple Powerbook notebooks.

I hadn't been thinking upgrading from XP to Vista, but I bought a new
Dell laptop earlier this year, and it came with Vista, so I said 'Why
not?'. Six months later, I am among the legions of people who are
[unimpressed with Vista](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/vista/what_went_wrong_with_windows_vista.html).
It's not that it's worse than XP, but Microsoft have
changed a lot of things, and virtually none of them are for the
better.

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/assets/img/hibernate_menu.gif"><img align="right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="/assets/img/hibernate_menu.gif" alt="Hibernate menu" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5145943170344353714" border="0" /></a>

For example, XP used to give you the choice whether to sleep, turn
off, or restart; and if you pressed the shift key, the sleep option
would change to hibernate. In Vista, the corresponding menu has no
hibernate option. This is a nuisance, because I dual boot my laptop,
and I use hibernate a lot.

And so on. The whole thing felt more sluggish than it should, given
that I'd moved to a laptop 3x more powerful; and there were other
niggling things, nothing broken exactly.

I thought I'd give them chance to redeem themselves with Vista Service
Pack 1 (SP1). I resisted the temptation to try SP1 Beta in September,
but when they released the
[Release Candidate](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/bb738089.aspx).

I just installed the Release Candidate (RC) of Vista SP1. The upgrade
took about an hour, as they warned, but otherwise went smoothly. Vista
and most apps work fine, but in two hours I have had problems with the
usually impeccable [PerfectDisk](http://www.raxco.com/products/perfectdisk2k/)
(offline defrag doesn't work) and
[Google Desktop](https://desktop.google.com/features.html)
(has crashed twice so far).

Given that post-SP1 Vista isn't noticeably different (they may have
shuffled the fields of the wireless connection dialog around, I'm not
sure) and a couple of apps have problems, I'd recommend that you don't
install SP1 until it's officially released.

I can't blame Microsoft when two apps that they don't control have
problems in a release which isn't production. But over the past ten
years, we have grown accustomed to the new release always being better
than the last. I'll have to revisit that assumption. And for future
Microsoft products, I'm downgrading my rating from 'sure, let's give
it a try' to 'skeptical'.
