Pentaho is hosting its first <a href="http://wiki.pentaho.org/display/COM/Pentaho+Community+Gathering+-+Mainz+2008">community meet-up in Mainz, Germany</a>, on 13th and 14th June, 2008.<br /><br />I will be there, and so will the leaders of the other Pentaho projects: Thomas Morgner (Pentaho Reporting), Matt Casters (Kettle), Mark Hall (Weka).<br /><br />The format of the meeting will be along the lines of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a>: no PowerPoint, lots of demos, audience participation, beer/wine on hand, and fun afterwards in the form of a cruise on the river Rhine. (Mainz is in the heart of Germany's wine country, so it would be difficult <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> to have fun!)<br /><br />Are you going to join us? What would you like to see at the meet-up? What application/technology could you demo?<br /><br />And by the way, if you can't wait until June, I will be giving a <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/detail/997">talk entitled "Creating Interactive OLAP Applications with MySQL Enterprise and Mondrian" at the MySQL conference</a> tomorrow in Santa Clara, California. Join me there... or find me on the conference floor/in the bar afterwards.
