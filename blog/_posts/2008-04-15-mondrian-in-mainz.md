Pentaho is hosting its first
[community meet-up in Mainz, Germany](https://wiki.pentaho.org/display/COM/Pentaho+Community+Gathering+-+Mainz+2008),
on 13th and 14th June, 2008.

I will be there, and so will the leaders of the other Pentaho
projects: Thomas Morgner (Pentaho Reporting), Matt Casters (Kettle),
Mark Hall (Weka).

The format of the meeting will be along the lines of a
[BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp): no
PowerPoint, lots of demos, audience participation, beer/wine on hand,
and fun afterwards in the form of a cruise on the river Rhine. (Mainz
is in the heart of Germany's wine country, so it would be difficult
*not* to have fun!)

Are you going to join us? What would you like to see at the meet-up?
What application/technology could you demo?

And by the way, if you can't wait until June, I will be giving a
[talk entitled "Creating Interactive OLAP Applications with MySQL Enterprise
and Mondrian" at the MySQL conference](https://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/detail/997)
tomorrow in Santa Clara, California. Join me there... or find me on
the conference floor/in the bar afterwards.
