Now that just about every data-management and business intelligence product claims that it handles "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a>", the term is approaching zero information content.<br/><br/>So, I'm shorting the term "Big Data". In the next few months, the marketers will realize that their audience realize that the term means nothing and, in accordance with <a href="http://www.strategicmessaging.com/monashs-first-law-of-commercial-semantics-explained/2009/01/09/">Monash's First Law of Commercial Semantics</a>, they'll start coming up with new terms.<br/><br/>Have any of those terms been spotted in the wild yet?<br/><br/>Though I'm still not clear what exactly Big Data is, I am fond of the term "Big Data Architecture". That term describes &mdash; fairly concisely, to the people who I want to understand me &mdash; the idea of a system where scalability is so important that it's best not to assume that there is only one of anything; where scalability is so important that it's worth revisiting all your assumptions; and where the raw performance of each component in the system is not paramount, because if the components can be composed in a scalable fashion, the system will meet its performance goals.<br/><br/>This architecture is going to be the standard for the kind of systems I build, so I think I'll be using the term "Big Data Architecture" for many years to come. If you can come up with got a good alternative to that one, I might just buy you a pint.
