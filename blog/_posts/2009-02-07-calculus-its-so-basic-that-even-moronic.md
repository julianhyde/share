The following [headline in the Daily
Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/facebook/4512806/Facebook-at-five-Ten-times-more-traffic-to-Twitter-website-than-Facebook-in-last-year.html)
struck me as really odd:

> Facebook at five: Ten times more traffic to Twitter website than Facebook in last year

The actual facts in the articleÂ show that the headline was patently false:

> Over the last year, traffic to Twitter [...] has increased by 1191
> per cent, while traffic to Facebook has grown just 110 per cent

> Facebook [...] received 133 times more UK internet visits than Twitter

If the headline had read "Ten times more growth in traffic to Twitter
website than Facebook in last year" or "133 times more traffic to
Twitter website than Facebook in last year", it would have been
correct. I'm guessing that the headline writer omitted the word
'growth', presumably to save an inch of headline space, and turned the
truth on its head: by a factor of a thousand.

The problem is that journalists are confusing a quantity
and the time derivative of that quantity, and it bugs the heck out of
me. Journalists who have a professional respect for punctuation,
grammar and fact-checking seem to have a disdain for basic numeracy
concepts like time derivatives. Do they not understand the difference,
or do they think that we're too dumb to notice?

I hear financial journalists trotting out that such and such tax would
"raise 15 million pounds". What, on the very morning it is introduced?
No; we, the reader, are supposed to insert "per year" to compensate
for the journalistic shorthand.

And here in the U.S., the terms "deficit" and "debt" are often used
synonymously in the public discourse, where in fact, one is the
derivative of the other. With record deficits and national debt
looming, and astronomical numbers that we have a duty as citizens to
try to comprehand, we need the help of journalists more than ever to
help us make sense of the world.
