There's going to be a talk on Mondrian at the FISL conference. <a href="mailto:pichiliani@uol.com.br">Mauro Pichiliani</a> writes:<br /><blockquote><i>I will present a paper about the use of Mondrian at the 8th International Free Software Forum - FISL - that will be held in Porto Alegre, Brazil (April 12, 13 and 14, 2007). This Forum is one of the biggest here in Latin America. It's a case study of Mondrian on the Telecom area, in which I was responsible for the modeling, creation of the cubes, ETL etc.</i></blockquote>Mauro's talk is entitled "Construindo cubos OLAP com c√≥digo-livre"; see <a href="http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/8.0/www/?q=pt-BR/pt-br/program">conference program</a> for more details.
