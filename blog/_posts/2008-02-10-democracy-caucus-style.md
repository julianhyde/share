I've heard a lot about caucuses since I moved to the United States
fifteen years ago, and particularly over the past few months. Caucuses
are like a living fossil, recalling the days when the Founding Fathers
were experimenting with this dangerous new idea called Democracy.

Since I'm not a US citizen, and I live in a state (California) which
does not have a caucus system, I'm not likely to experience a caucus
any time soon. So I was pleased to hear about one first-hand from my
friend Eric in Colorado. In Eric's words:

What was the experience like?

I still wish I'd been there. As Winston Churchill said, Democracy is
the second worst form of government; the only worse form is all of the
others.
