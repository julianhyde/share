**Your birthday** involves presents and cake. The day after your
birthday you are allowed to say "I am <i>x</i>", where <i>x</i> is the
number of candles on your cake.

**4th of July** is the birthday of our country, which is called
America. America has decided that it doesn't want presents or a cake,
just fireworks.

**Thanksgiving** is a big meal with your family. We eat a turkey,
which is basically a very large chicken.

**Christmas** celebrates the first birthday, a very long time ago, of
a baby who was very special, a bit like a king but without a palace or
anything, who grew up to be very, very nice indeed, so nice that he
made everyone else a bit nicer. And there were shepherds and
animals. Also, kind of like a birthday for everyone, because everyone
gets presents, although giving them is the important part. Also, we
have an indoor tree with lights and things on it. Also, we have a meal
exactly like Thanksgiving.

**New Year**. We all need new calendars tomorrow. Train calendars are
best.

Happy New Year, everyone. I hope you get the train calendar your heart
desires.
