I am delighted to announce an upcoming book all about Mondrian, called
"Mondrian in Action". Some chapters are available in electronic form
now, and the final print version is scheduled to hit the shelves in
Spring, 2013. For one day only, there is a 50% discount if you
pre-order the book and join the
[early-access program](https://www.manning.com/back/).

Whoever heard of a successful open source project that didn't have a
book? Mondrian has become successful without one... but our
long-suffering users have had to piece together documentation from the
scrappy online documentation, forum posts and mailing list
archives. For years, my answer has been, "A book is a great idea, but
I'm just too busy writing software!" Finally, I've teamed up with two
Mondrian and Pentaho experts, [Bill Back](https://billonbi.wordpress.com/)
([@billbackbi](https://twitter.com/billbackbi))
and [Nicholas Goodman](http://www.nicholasgoodman.com/)
([@nagoodman](https://twitter.com/nagoodman)),
and we've set out to create the definitive guide. Now all the
information will be in one place, right there between on your desk
between your keyboard and your coffee mug.

Mondrian in Action serves several audiences. It explains to end-users
and CIOs how Mondrian analytics can unlock the value in business
data. For&nbsp;schema developers and DBAs, it describes in depth to
how to create and administer a Mondrian system. Mondrian in Action
covers the upcoming Mondrian 4 release, and includes chapters on
security, multi-tenancy, and integration with other tools such as the
[Pentaho Business Analytics](https://www.pentaho.com/explore/products/)
suite and [Saiku](http://analytical-labs.com/), advanced
analytics and visualizations, and integration with Big Data
technologies.

The book is part of the acclaimed "In Action" series from
[Manning Publications](https://manning.com/).
Books in this series are known for their direct
approach to the subject, and concrete, practical examples. For
countless open source projects, the definitive guide is an "In Action"
book.

Speaking of open source, the
[Manning Early-Access Program (MEAP)](https://www.manning.com/about/meap.html)
is a 'release early, release often'
process. This helps the community shape the book while it is being
written. One chapter of the book is available to all. If you pre-order
the book, you will get electronic access to draft chapters as they are
completed, and a print copy when it is released. There is a forum
where you can post questions and give feedback on the book.

Manning are offering a 50% discount for one day only. (It expires at
midnight, eastern time, on November 1st.) Go to the publisher's site,
[http://www.manning.com/back](https://www.manning.com/back),
and enter discount code `dotd1101au`.
