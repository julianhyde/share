We can't be "Big Data" because we do out damnedest to process data as fast as we receive it, in memory. I guess "Fast Data" would be a better word for what we do. And we can't be "NoSQL" because we're the biggest cheerleaders for industry-standard SQL you'll find anywhere outside Redwood Shores or Almaden.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>But we founded the company because we foresaw the onset of massive quantities of data, requiring efficiently-delivered low-latency results, and the impending failure (or at least faltering) of the classical database architecture to solve them. So, the forces driving us are the same forces driving Big Data and NoSQL.<br /><br />SQLstream CEO <a href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/10/speakers/#damian_black">Damian Black</a> will be a appearing on the the "Big Data: Dealing with the Data Tsunami" panel at the&nbsp;<a href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/10/">Structure 2010</a> conference this week, so he took the occasion to write a <a href="http://www.sqlstream.com/blog/2010/06/big-data-dealing-with-the-data-tsunami/">blog post to set out his views</a> on the subject.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/10/files/2009/12/01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://events.gigaom.com/structure/10/files/2009/12/01.jpg" /></a></div>Structure 2010 is an excellent conference, distinguished by the quality of its speakers and its attendees, and known for its intimate atmosphere. I will be in the audience both tomorrow and Thursday finding out what's new. Follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/julianhyde">twitter @julianhyde</a> or even better, come and introduce yourself.
