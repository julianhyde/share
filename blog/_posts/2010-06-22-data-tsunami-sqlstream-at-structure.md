At [SQLstream](https://www.sqlstream.com/), we have no doubt
that streaming SQL and stream computing will be a key part of the
next-generation enterprise infrastructure, but we are less certain how
we fit into trends such as "[Big Data](http://gigaom.com/2010/05/31/commercializing-big-data/)"
and "[NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)".

Taking the terms absolutely literally, we aren't either. We can't be
"Big Data" because we do out damnedest to process data as fast as we
receive it, in memory. I guess "Fast Data" would be a better word for
what we do. And we can't be "NoSQL" because we're the biggest
cheerleaders for industry-standard SQL you'll find anywhere outside
Redwood Shores or Almaden.

But we founded the company because we foresaw the onset of massive
quantities of data, requiring efficiently-delivered low-latency
results, and the impending failure (or at least faltering) of the
classical database architecture to solve them. So, the forces driving
us are the same forces driving Big Data and NoSQL.

SQLstream CEO [Damian Black](http://events.gigaom.com/structure/10/speakers/#damian_black)
will be a appearing on the the "Big Data: Dealing with the
Data Tsunami" panel at the [Structure 2010](http://events.gigaom.com/structure/10/)
conference this week, so he took the occasion to write a
[blog post to set out his views](https://www.sqlstream.com/blog/2010/06/big-data-dealing-with-the-data-tsunami/)
on the subject.

Structure 2010 is an excellent
conference, distinguished by the quality of its speakers and its
attendees, and known for its intimate atmosphere. I will be in the
audience both tomorrow and Thursday finding out what's new. Follow me
on [twitter @julianhyde](https://twitter.com/julianhyde) or
even better, come and introduce yourself.
