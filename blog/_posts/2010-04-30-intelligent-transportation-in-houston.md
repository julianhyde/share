I'm off to Houston for the [annual meeting](http://www.itsa.org/annualmeeting.html) of
the [Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA)](http://www.itsa.org/).

On Monday, I will be speaking on a panel on next-generation standards
and architecture for Intelligent Transportation systems. Also present
on that panel will be senior members of the U.S. Department of
Transportation.

[SQLstream](https://www.sqlstream.com) is helping to
simplify how traffic information is collected, analyzed, and acted
upon in real time. In one application, SQLstream is gathering
information from a fleet of 7,000 vehicles with GPS sensors and using
that information to build a real-time picture of a state-wide freeway
system. That information allows government agencies to manage traffic
flow, respond to incidents, and plan capacity.
