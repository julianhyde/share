You can't fault nature.

We've been [counting raptors]({% post_url 2008-08-27-hawkwatch %})
for almost a month now, and the numbers have been really,
really low. I've been promising everyone that the peak of raptor
migration, will be within a day or two of the equinox, because that's
how it always goes, but I was getting worried.

We weren't seeing enough birds. In particular, the
[accipiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter) (the
Cooper's Hawk and Sharp-shinned Hawk), which form the bulk of the
equinox peak, were nowhere to be seen. The counts consisted mainly of
the Turkey Vultures and Red-tailed Hawks which are ubiquitous around
Hawk Hill. Had something gone wrong? Had this summer's forest fires
disrupted the breeding season and delayed the migration?

Look at the
[accipiter numbers](http://ggro.org/hawkwatch/default.aspx) for last week:

* Sun 7: 2 sharpies, no coops
* Mon 8: no birds (fog)
* Tue 9: no sharpies, 1 coop
* Wed 10: 1 sharpie, 1 coop
* Thu 11: 8 sharpies, 3 coops
* Fri 12: 5 sharpies, 3 coops

Then came my day on the hill, Saturday. It was a slow start, foggy at
first, and overcast for most of the day, but the birds started
coming. We had 40 sharpies, 8 coops. We also got a juvenile
[Golden Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Eagle) (at
10.30am even -- conventional wisdom has it that eagles are late
risers, like the thermals they soar upon), and a couple of
[Broad-winged Hawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-winged_Hawk).
(According to the books, you won't see a broadie west of
Kansas, but the
[Marin Headlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Headlands#Wildlife)
are very effective at channeling the few we do have into
a narrow stream.)

* Sat 13: 40 sharpies, 8 coops

And in the last couple of days, the trend has
accelerated:

* Sun 14: 111 sharpies, 29 coops
* Mon 15: 133 sharpies, 44 coops

Yes folks, it looks like we have a fall migration after all. As sure
as clockwork, the [changing day-length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration#Timing)
is telling those birds to head south. [Check the counts](http://www.hydromatic.net/ggro.xml) over
the next week or two, you should see the spectacle continue.
