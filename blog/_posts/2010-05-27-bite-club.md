It's modeled on the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_box_scheme">veggie box</a>" schemes used by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_supported_agriculture">Community Supported Agriculture</a> farms, except that rather than vegetables, the each week's box contains home-baked goods.<br /><br />We received the first box yesterday. It contained potato and spring pea pasties, a ginger and black pepper cake, millet muffins, and a dozen sesame cookies with Hawaiian sea salt.<br /><br />Everything was delicious. We're especially pleased with the savory items, because it's always a challenge to create simple, healthy family meals we can enjoy with our son. We're hoping that in future weeks the box will contain pot pies, quichen, samosas, and the like.<br /><br />Cindy and Terry don't have a web site yet. If you're in South Berkeley, drop me a line and I'll tell you how to sign up.<br /><br /><em>Update</em>: I was wrong; they do have a site: it's <a href="http://freshbitebaking.com/bite-club">http://freshbitebaking.com/bite-club</a>.
