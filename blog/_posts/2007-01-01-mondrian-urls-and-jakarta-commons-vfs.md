If you've used Mondrian, you're probably familiar with how Mondrian loads its schema from a URL embedded in the connect string.<br /><br />A Mondrian connection is a URL which contains a reference to an XML file containing a Mondrian schema definition, information to connect to the JDBC database which holds the data, and various other parameters. For example,<br /><blockquote><code>Provider=Mondrian; Jdbc='jdbc:mysql://localhost/foodmart'; JdbcUser=foodmart; JdbcPassword=foodmart; JdbcDrivers=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver; Catalog=file:demo/FoodMart.xml</code><br /></blockquote>Embedded within the connect string URL is another URL, here <code>file:demo/FoodMart.xml</code>, from where Mondrian should load its schema.<br /><br />Until now, the URL following the <code>Catalog</code> keyword could only one of the small number of protocols supported by <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/URL.html">java.net.URL</a>, such as 'http' or 'file'. I've just changed Mondrian to use <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/vfs/">Jakarta Commons VFS</a> to resolve URLs, which is a more powerful and extensible scheme.<br /><br />With VFS, you can use the same builtin protocols, some <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/vfs/filesystems.html">new builtin protocols</a>, and even define your own protocol. For example, when used within <a href="http://www.pentaho.com/products/bi_platform/">Pentaho BI Platform</a>, Mondrian could use the URL<br /><blockquote><code>solution:/sales/schemas/my_mondrian_model.xml</code></blockquote>to reference a Mondrian schema file stored within Pentaho's solution repository. This is possible because the Pentaho folks have exposed their solution repository as a custom filesystem.<br /><br />You can even create a URL which references a file within a JAR within a zip that exists on an FTP site.<br /><br />This change will be released as part of mondrian-2.3.
