It's that time of year when the days are getting imperceptibly
shorter, birds start thinking of heading south, and a couple of
hundred volunteer birders of the
[Golden Gate Raptor Observatory (GGRO)](http://www.ggro.org/)
head to Hawk Hill to watch them.

Hawk Hill is at the southern tip of the
[Marin Headlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Headlands#Wildlife)
overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, which naturally
funnels migrating raptors from a fifty mile stretch into less than a
mile. The result is a huge concentration of raptors. During peak
season -- which, not coincidentally, is usually within a day or two of
the autumn solstice -- you will typically see over 100 birds an hour
from 12 or 13 species of raptors, including eagles, falcons,
[accipiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipiter) and some of the rarer
[buteo hawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo).

It has to be seen to be believed, so if you're curious, come up to
Hawk Hill and see for yourself. When you get there, on any day between
late August and early December, as long as Hawk Hill isn't shrouded in
fog, you'll find about a dozen volunteers with binoculars counting
hawks.

The GGRO has been counting and banding raptors at this site for over
twenty years. I have been volunteering for 6 years, and this year I
have stepped up to be day leader of the
[Saturday II hawkwatch team](https://groups.google.com/group/hawkwatchsatii).
With the depth of hawk-watching experience on the
team, it's not too onerous a job. The main responsibility is to ensure
that the numbers are recorded systematically -- this is a scientific
study, after all -- and, when the fog rolls in, to tell the team that
it's time to hang up the binoculars for the day.

To help me keep up with the action, I built an
[RSS feed](http://www.hydromatic.net/ggro/feed.xml) that
contains a summary of each day's hawk watching, including a count of
each species of raptor. The first week was a wash -- fog every day --
but we can expect to see numbers, particularly of the accipiters
(Cooper's hawk and Sharp-shinned hawk), climbing rapidly over the next
two or three weeks. Subscribe to that feed and you can get daily
updates too; or even better, join us on the hill!
