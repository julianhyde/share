OpenMRS stands for 'Open Medical Records System', and is a major
open-source project aiming to build medical information systems for
developing countries. Their general goal is to provide a low-cost
(free) solution for tracking patient conditions. Their specific goal
is to fight AIDS in Africa.

Their website is [http://openmrs.org/wiki/OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/wiki/OpenMRS).

The project is gaining a lot of momentum. They have strong links with
organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), corporate
sponsorship from companies such as Google, and are already deployed in
12 countries.

The OpenMRS architects are are in the process of adding analytics
using mondrian. I have committed to helping them out, and
[Matt Casters](http://www.ibridge.be/)
(architect of [Pentaho Data Integration aka Kettle](https://kettle.pentaho.org/))
is also involved. They are looking for committers do build
the mondrian schema and analytics, and that's why I'm reaching out to
the mondrian community.

Maybe you have used mondrian in a commercial project, and are looking
to use those skills in a project which makes the world a better
place. Maybe you have some experience with databases and data
modeling, but want to hone those skills on a real project and improve
your CV. If you are student or have limited income, they have some
stipends available.

I urge you to get involved with this project. Go to the website and
sign up! If you know anyone who would be interested in this project,
please forward this to them.
