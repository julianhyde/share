<p>OpenMRS stands for 'Open Medical Records System', and is a major open-source project aiming to build medical information systems for developing countries. Their general goal is to provide a low-cost (free) solution for tracking patient conditions. Their specific goal is to fight AIDS in Africa.</p><p>Their website is <a href="http://openmrs.org/wiki/OpenMRS">http://openmrs.org/wiki/OpenMRS</a>.</p><p>The project is gaining a lot of momentum. They have strong links with organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), corporate sponsorship from companies such as Google, and are already deployed in 12 countries.</p>The OpenMRS architects are are in the process of adding analytics using mondrian. I have committed to helping them out, and <a href="http://www.ibridge.be/">Matt Casters</a> (architect of <a href="http://kettle.pentaho.org/">Pentaho Data Integration aka Kettle</a>) is also involved. They are looking for committers do build the mondrian schema and analytics, and that's why I'm reaching out to the mondrian community.<br /><p>Maybe you have used mondrian in a commercial project, and are looking to use those skills in a project which makes the world a better place. Maybe you have some experience with databases and data modeling, but want to hone those skills on a real project and improve your CV. If you are student or have limited income, they have some stipends available.</p>I urge you to get involved with this project. Go to the website and sign up! If you know anyone who would be interested in this project, please forward this to them.
