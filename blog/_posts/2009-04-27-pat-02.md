PAT (Pentaho Analysis Tool) project renews my faith in open source. A
team of folks from Pentaho's community have got together and are
cooking up a new UI for Mondrian. Due to the magic of olap4j, it will
work against other OLAP engines too.

They just released version 0.2, and
[Tom's release notes](https://pentahomusings.blogspot.com/2009/04/pat-02-arrives.html)
are an amusing and informative history of the project.
