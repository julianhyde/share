It's time for the annual BI Survey, which is organized by Nigel
Pendse, the author of the [OLAP Report](http://www.olapreport.com/).

Says [Doug Moran](https://community.pentaho.org/newsletter/commletter_07172007.html),
"Last year, even though Mondrian was not included in the survey, there
were enough write in votes that it was included in the final
report. It ranked better than established proprietary BI tools like:
Hyperion Planning, Information Builders WebFOCUS and Business Objects
Cartesis. This year, thanks to community support, Pentaho/Mondrian has
been added as a specific technology choice in the survey."

This is your chance to let us, and the world, know how you use
Mondrian/Pentaho, and what you think of it. Please participate.
