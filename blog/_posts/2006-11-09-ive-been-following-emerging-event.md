I've been following the emerging
[Event-Stream Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Stream_Processing_%28ESP%29)
field (also known as Streaming Database or Complex Event Processing)
for a few years now. The relational database movement tamed disk-bound
transactional data with a set of engineering techniques built on sound
theoretical principles, and streaming databases offer to do the same
for data in flight.

"Data in flight" is a broad term, encompassing signals generated by
sensors, deltas generated by transaction processing, patterns
recognized by algorithmic trading rules and intrusion-detection
systems, and records flowing within a global enterprise's
service-oriented architecture. The streaming database approach --
though not currently any one product -- can in principle address all
of these application areas.

The relational database world fractured, for a time at least, into
sub-disciplines: embedded databases, object-oriented databases, data
warehousing engines, rule-based databases (I'm thinking of datalog
here) and transaction-processing engines, before the likes of Oracle,
SQL Server and DB2 could truly call themselves general-purpose
databases. So, it's interesting to see the same ecological niches
being filled in the streaming database landscape.

Among the companies out there, [Coral8](http://www.coral8.com/)
and [Streambase](http://www.streambase.com/) are SQL-centric and
inclined to applications involving analytics,
[Progress Apama ESP](http://www.progress.com/apama/apama_esp/index.ssp)
has a more rule-based approach,
the open-source [Esper](http://esper.codehaus.org/) engine is embedded
and written in pure Java, and there are several more companies each
with their own vision of what a streaming database (or event-stream
processing engine, if you prefer) should look like.

The article
"[Building Real-Time Applications with Continuous Query Technology](http://developer.gemstone.com/display/gfedev/Continuous+Querying+Technology)"
in August's Java Developers Journal is the first time in a few years
that [Gemstone](http://www.gemstone.com/) have drifted onto my
radar. Back in the day, Gemstone pioneered object-databases, which
aimed to make disk-based data more accessible to people who wrote
object-oriented 3GL code, and in particular complex user-interfaces,
for a living.

So it's no surprise that Gemstone bring the same mindset to what they
call "continuous query". Again, they're looking at the problem from
the application developer's perspective, and the article describes a
compelling programming model for Java-based developers, although I
can't speak for the robustness of the engine underneath it all.

The event-stream processing (ESP) field is still young, yet already
the diversity of products in the arena is inspiring. ESP is finding a
wide variety of applications, and vendors are adopting a
correspondingly wide range of architectures. Don't hold your breath
waiting for a standard to emerge, but the ESP approach is looking more
and more sound.
