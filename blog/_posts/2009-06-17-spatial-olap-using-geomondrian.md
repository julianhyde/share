I received an email from Thierry Badard of Laval University, Qu√©bec:<br /><blockquote>After the release of a new version of its open source spatial ETL tool, <a href="http://www.geokettle.org/">GeoKettle</a> yesterday (please see <a href="http://geosoa.scg.ulaval.ca/en/index.php?module=announce&amp;ANN_user_op=view&amp;ANN_id=12">the announcement</a> for more details), the <a href="http://geosoa.scg.ulaval.ca/">GeoSOA research group at Laval University, Quebec, Canada</a> is proud to announce the availibility as new open source projects of <a href="http://www.geo-mondrian.org/">GeoMondrian</a>, the first implementation of a Spatial OLAP (SOLAP) server and <a href="http://www.spatialytics.org/">Spatialytics</a>, a lightweight cartographic component which enables navigation in SOLAP data cubes.</blockquote><blockquote>GeoKettle, GeoMondrian and Spatialytics are components of the complete geospatial BI (Business Intelligence) software stack developed by the GeoSOA research group.<br /></blockquote>For some screenshots of the project, see <a href="http://www.geobi.org/2009/03/georeport-pentaho-cdf-integration-has.html">Fabio D'Ovidio's blog</a>.<br /><br /><div>This is the kind of news that makes me proud to have gotten involved in open source. I'm not an expert on spatial software, so I could never have written a spatial OLAP engine; I didn't even realize the need existed. I'm delighted that people who are experts in the field could build upon my efforts and all of the other people who have contributed to <a href="http://mondrian.pentaho.org">Mondrian</a> and <a href="http://jpivot.sourceforge.net">JPivot</a> over the years.</div><div><br /><div><div>I hear that they are also involved in a <a href="http://www.geobi.org/2009/06/geolap-news-from-gsoc-2009.html">Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project to integrate with Pentaho Community Dashboard Framework (CDF)</a>. That makes a lot of sense.</div><div><br /></div>And of course I would be happy to receive contributions back to Mondrian if it makes it easier for them to maintain the code base.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wish the GeoMondrian, GeoKettle and Spatialytics projects every success, and look forward to them bringing BI to a new audience.</div></div>
