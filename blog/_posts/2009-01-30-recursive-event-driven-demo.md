I just gave a demo of [SQLstream](https://www.sqlstream.com/) to
[Joe di Paolantonio](https://twitter.com/jadp). I gave Joe a couple of
the usual demos, including [the one where we read feeds from Twitter,
Google news and various RSS
feeds](http://www.intelligententerprise.com/blog/archives/2008/12/bi_on_content_f.html).
Joe sent a real-time commentary as a
[series of tweets](https://twitter.com/JAdP/status/1162682145),
and these duly showed up in the demo.

A bit of a stunt, but it was cool, in a geeky
[Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter)-esque
recursion kind of way. Then we had lunch; good chinese food, and
blissfully offline.
