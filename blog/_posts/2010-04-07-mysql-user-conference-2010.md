Are you at the MySQL conference this year? I'm giving a
[talk about SQLstream](https://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/detail/13444)
at 5.15pm on Wednesday 14th (a week from today),
but as ever, I'll be wearing both my hats. I'm always ready &
willing to chat about mondrian, Pentaho, streaming SQL, open source
BI, and the future of intelligent life in the universe.

If you're going to be at the show, let's see if we can hook up. Email
me directly, or reach me on twitter [@julianhyde](https://twitter.com/julianhyde).
If you want to try to randomly bump into me, first try the Pentaho booth, then try
the bar...
