I forgot to mention Paul St√∂llberger. Sorry Paul!)<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>No hard feelings! I, and some other key Pentaho folks, are delighted that this project is happening, and will support it any way we can.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's ironic that when Pentaho seeded a project to build an olap4j-based viewer, they chose an organic, open-sourcey name 'halogen', yet these folks (none of whom works for Pentaho) chose a name that whiffs of corporate branding.</div><div><br /></div><div>A rose by any other name, as they say.  And despite the name, the viewer should work on top of any olap4j data source (which today means <a href="http://mondrian.pentaho.org/">Mondrian</a> and any OLAP engine with an XMLA interface).</div>
