Jeff Jonas writes about the
[challenges of managing data privacy](https://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/2010/12/big-data-flows-vs-wicked-leaks-.html)
when the data concerned is Big Data. He
advocates taking a real-time approach to auditing user behavior:

> ** Real-time active audits**.  It is now going to be essential that

I must say, it hadn't occurred to me that privacy management could be
seen as a real-time data problem. But he's right that large data sets,
when not acted upon immediately, can become part of the problem. In
his words, "just another big pile of data".
