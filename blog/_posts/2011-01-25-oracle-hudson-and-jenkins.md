An open source project builds its brand by several years of high-quality releases and effective support in its community. Whoever owns the trademark of a project controls that brand.<br /><br />Here is <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/docs/process_summary.html">Oracle's proposal for the future of the project</a>, and the <a href="http://kohsuke.org/2011/01/24/on-oracle-proposal-about-hudson/">response of one of the project's lead developers</a>.<br /><br />It's an interesting study in the fragile dynamics of an open source project's community. Oracle clearly don't understand how fragile the power balance is. The community is spooked; not so much by Oracle's ability to enforce its trademark (they claim they would never do that) but by their presumption that they have more of a say in the project than anyone else.<br /><br />My two cents? Oracle are not evil, but they are being naive and are coming across as complete dicks. If I were a member of the active Hudson community (I'm a happy user of Hudson, since it powers <a href="http://ci.pentaho.com/">Pentaho's continuous integration site</a>, but I wouldn't say that makes me a community member) I'd certainly give my +1 to fork and change the name of the project to Jenkins. There's little reason not to.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://hudson-ci.org/images/butler.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a></div>
