From [Mr. Goodman](http://www.nicholasgoodman.com/bt/blog/2008/09/22/off-topic-meme-me/)
this morning. A blogger equivalent of “send this mail to 10 people you
know”.

1. Take a picture of yourself right now.
2. Don’t change your clothes, don’t fix your hair... just take a picture.
3. Post that picture with NO editing.
4. Post these instructions with your picture.

PS I'm on [workation](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Workation)
a friend's cottage in [Pacific Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Grove,_California)
for a few days, so don't have my camera to hand. I had to learn how to
send a picture from my phone to my PC via Bluetooth. Cool.
