Those of you who follow me in
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/julianhyde) and
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=706953192)
will know that my thoughts have been on
[the birth of my son, Sebastian Hyde](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=65483&amp;id=706953192),
and not on open-source BI or streaming SQL as much as usual.

British fathers often celebrate their baby's arrival by "wetting the
baby's head" at a local hostelry. Unlike the Christening ceremony that
it is patterned after, this involves lots of beer but no baby. My
friend Rhys (who, my American readers may like to note, is British but
not English) devised a variation of that tradition he called "baby
bingo", and we carried out the ceremony at
[Barclay's pub](http://www.barclayspub.com/) on Friday.

As my father
[well knows](https://web.archive.org/web/20080115184417/http://www.expressandstar.com/2007/10/06/festival-pot-tribute-to-legend/),
beer and commemorative plaques go together. Rhys, Jacq and Sabine just
presented us an excellent framed image listing the beers that we
consumed in Sebastian's honor. I wonder what Sebastian will make of it
when he's older?
