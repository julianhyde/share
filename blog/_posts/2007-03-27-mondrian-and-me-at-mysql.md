<span style="width: 500px;"><span style="">I am giving a talk at the <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/"><span class="hl">MySQL</span> user conference</a>, April 23-26, Santa Clara, California. The talk is titled "<a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/cs/mysqluc2007/view/e_sess/10631">Building Scalable OLAP Applications with Mondrian and <span class="hl">MySQL</span></a>" (<a href="http://www.hydromatic.net/mondrian_mysqluc2007.ppt">slides</a>).<br /><br />When I gave a talk "Building OLAP Applications with Mondrian and <span class="hl">MySQL</span>" at the 2006 <span class="hl">MySQL</span> UC, it was my first chance to meet a lot of you in the mondrian and pentaho communities. It was great to finally put faces to email addresses. But it was frustrating that there wasn't enough time to have in-depth discussions and answer everyone's questions.<br /><br />So this year we thought we'd solve that by hosting a <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/cs/mysqluc2007/view/e_sess/13801"><span class="hl">Birds</span> of a <span class="hl">Feather</span> session on Tuesday evening</a>. I want the session to be really interactive. The format of session will be a series of 'micro talks', each two or three slides about a particular mondrian feature or common problem, and plenty of chance to interrupt and ask questions.<br /><br />Which features would you like to hear better explained? What features would you like to see on the roadmap?  Let me know.<br /><br />I will be joined by <a href="http://www.ibridge.be/">Matt <span class="hl">Casters</span></a>,  architect of <a href="http://kettle.pentaho.org/">Pentaho's Kettle ETL engine</a>, so we can talk about how to make mondrian, kettle and pentaho work together.</span></span>
