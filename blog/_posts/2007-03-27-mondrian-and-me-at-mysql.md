I am giving a talk at the [MySQL user conference](http://www.mysqlconf.com/),
April 23-26, Santa Clara, California. The talk is titled
"[Building Scalable OLAP Applications with Mondrian and MySQL](http://www.mysqlconf.com/cs/mysqluc2007/view/e_sess/10631)"
([slides](http://www.hydromatic.net/mondrian_mysqluc2007.ppt)).

When I gave a talk "Building OLAP Applications with Mondrian and
MySQL" at the 2006 MySQL UC, it was my first chance to meet a lot of
you in the mondrian and pentaho communities. It was great to finally
put faces to email addresses. But it was frustrating that there wasn't
enough time to have in-depth discussions and answer everyone's
questions.

So this year we thought we'd solve that by hosting a
[Birds of a Feather session on Tuesday evening](http://www.mysqlconf.com/cs/mysqluc2007/view/e_sess/13801).
I want the session to be really interactive. The format of session
will be a series of 'micro talks', each two or three slides about a
particular mondrian feature or common problem, and plenty of chance to
interrupt and ask questions.

Which features would you like to hear better explained? What features
would you like to see on the roadmap?  Let me know.

I will be joined by [Matt Casters](http://www.ibridge.be/),
architect of [Pentaho's Kettle ETL engine](https://kettle.pentaho.org/),
so we can talk about how to make mondrian, kettle and pentaho work together.
