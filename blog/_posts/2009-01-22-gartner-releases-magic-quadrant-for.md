Gartner have released their
[2009 Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence](http://mediaproducts.gartner.com/reprints/sas/vol5/article8/article8.html)
(via [DBMS2](http://www.dbms2.com/2009/01/22/gartners-2009-magic-quadrant-for-business-intelligence/)).

[Pentaho](https://www.pentaho.com/) has not made it onto the
quadrant diagram yet (I suppose because they have not crossed the $20M
revenue threshold), but earns its own paragraph in the accompanying
commentary:

> Pentaho, after just four years in existence, has put together a
> comprehensive open-source BI platform that includes data integration
> and data mining capabilities. In 2008, Pentaho was noticeably more
> aggressive, openly competing against traditional BI platform
> vendors. Like Jaspersoft, Pentaho is affordable and also offers a
> subscription-based model that avoids an initial large payment for
> the software license. Some of the significant features Pentaho
> introduced in 2008 include an automatic table designer that analyzes
> relational schemas and data patterns, performs a cost-benefit
> analysis of aggregation at different levels, and generates and
> populates those aggregate tables. Despite a handful of large
> customers, Pentaho reference survey respondents more frequently
> indicated that they had more departmental deployments (versus
> enterprisewide) and smaller data volumes compared with the other
> vendors.

Nice that the aggregate table designer gets a call-out. It's very
important in helping Mondrian scale to enterprise-scale data
warehouses. (And besides, it was a lot of work to write!)

> This was in evidence in the MQ reference survey, as both Jaspersoft
> and particularly Pentaho scored strongly on the customer support
> question -- higher than any of the megavendors.
