Would you like to find out how to build a continuous ETL process
integrating source systems, MySQL data warehouse, and Mondrian OLAP
engine?

I'm going to be hosting a webinar tomorrow describing how to do this
using SQLstream. (Basically a repeat of the webinar I gave at the
MySQL conference this year, but many of you missed it.)

Join me and Damian Black, CEO of SQLstream, on the webinar at 11am
PDT/2pm EDT tomorrow, Wednesday 27th May. To register for the webinar,
