Funny what you find while googling for error messages: apparently <a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=2340835">mondrian runs on TimesTen</a>.<br /><br />One of the bizarre things about open source is that you have no way of knowing who is using your project, and on what platform. (Until they find something wrong, that is.)
