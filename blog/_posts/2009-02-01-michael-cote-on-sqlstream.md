In their weekly podcast John M. Willis <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2009/01/31/it-management-podcast-34-cloud-taxonomy-scom-realtime-data-warehousing/">discusses SQLstream</a> with <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/about/">Redmonk's Michael Coté</a>.<div><br /></div><div>[Edit: This originally read "In his weekly podcast, Redmonk's Michael Coté discusses SQLstream with John M. Willis."]<br /><div><blockquote>"Is anybody foolish enough to think that one screen is going to be able to tell you what is going on?</blockquote><blockquote>I've actually seen customers try [...] to do ETLs every 15 minutes  in order to look at what's goin' on, aggregating your data and doing analytics  on your data, [...] which is at least a 15-fold [improvement  over] using a single-pane-of-glass. [If you do that,] you can avert  major<span> </span>disasters because you're watching the  trend happen.</blockquote><blockquote>I think that something like SQLstream, or something like  that, that is watching it as it goes [...] has  brilliant<span>  </span>potential."</blockquote></div>The action starts at around 1:10:00 in <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/redmonk/itmanagement034.mp3">the podcast</a>.</div>
