> Is anybody foolish enough to think that one screen is going to be

> I've actually seen customers try [...] to do ETLs every 15 minutes
> in order to look at what's goin' on, aggregating your data and doing
> analytics on your data, [...] which is at least a 15-fold
> [improvement over] using a single-pane-of-glass. [If you do that,]
> you can avert major disasters because you're watching the trend
> happen.

> I think that something like SQLstream, or something like that, that
> is watching it as it goes [...] has brilliant potential.
