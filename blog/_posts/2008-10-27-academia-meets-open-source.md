There is a natural fit between university students and researchers and
the open source community. They are smart, educated, short of cash,
and want to make the world a better place; and some of them, at least,
have plenty of spare time.

More seriously, open source projects are a great platform for software
research. By starting with a mature software platform, the researchers
can spend less time recreating existing functionality, and get to the
new, interesting stuff faster. The findings of such projects are more
applicable to the real world because the new ideas have been tested in
realistic architectures and on data sets of a reasonable size. In the
area of spatial (GIS) applications alone, there are
[several projects](https://www.google.com/search?q=%28spatial+or+gis%29+mondrian),
including the work of
[Joel da Silva and others at Pernambuco, Brazil](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1141277.1141292&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=8047493&amp;CFTOKEN=97746316),
the [GeWOlap](http://people.plan.aau.dk/%7Eenc/AGILE2007/PDF/28_PDF.pdf)
project, and [GeoMondrian](http://geosoa.scg.ulaval.ca/).

Still, the majority of the mondrian and Pentaho communities are from
industry. I would love to get more committers and active community
members from academia.

[Open Source Boot Camp (OSBOOTCAMP)](http://osbootcamp.org/)
is a mini-conference which is trying to put that
right. I will be participating in a
[panel on open-source database development at Berkeley this Thursday 30th October](http://osbootcamp.org/index.php?page=oak1),
along with open-source advocates Bill Maimone (Ingres), Josh Berkus
(PostgreSQL), Mark Atwood (MySQL) and John Sichi (LucidDB).
