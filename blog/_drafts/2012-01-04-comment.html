<br /><div class="p1">We've decided to change <a href="http://www.olap4j.org/">olap4j</a>'s license to the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache Software License, Version 2.0</a> (ASL).</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I hope to find time to write a post describing in more detail the rationale for the license change and the choice of license. For now, suffice it to say that the license change will be good for olap4j's adoption and long-term success, and good for its users. ASL is a very permissive license, and is arguably <a href="http://www.openlogic.com/news/press/05.16.11.php">becoming the standard license for open source enterprise software</a>.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The committers have agreed to the license change, and we will be making the changes to the code base over the next few days and making a point release under the new license shortly.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Happy new year everyone.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Julian</div>
