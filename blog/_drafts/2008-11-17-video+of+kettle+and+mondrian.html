There's a nice video which shows how you can use Kettle together with the Mondrian Schema Workbench to populate a star schema and build cubes on top of it.<br /><br />See "Pentaho Data Integration and Schema Workbench Tutorial" on the <a href="http://www.pentaho.com/products/demos/presales_tools.php">Pentaho web site</a>.
