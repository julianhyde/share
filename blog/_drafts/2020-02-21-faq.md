Here are some FAQs that explain the decisions behind Morel.

# Why build on Standard ML, not Haskell or Scala?

Standard ML is a small language.

Larger languages such as Haskell or Scala are too large for one person
to implement, or to productively hack an existing implementation.

If the Morel experiment is successful, relational extensions could be
added to those languages.
